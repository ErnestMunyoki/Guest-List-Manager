## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add a guest's name via the input field
- ➕ Click "Submit" to add the guest to the list
- 📃 View the guest’s name immediately on the page
- ❌ Remove guests using a "Remove" button next to each name
- ⚠️ Guest list is limited to **10 guests** – you'll get an alert if you exceed the limit
- 🔁 Toggle RSVP status between **"Attending"** and **"Not Attending"**

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Type** the name of a guest in the input field
2. **Click** the “Submit” button
3. The guest appears in the list with:
   - A **Remove** button to delete them
   - A **Toggle RSVP** button to mark attendance

If you try to add more than 10 guests, the app will notify you and prevent the addition.
